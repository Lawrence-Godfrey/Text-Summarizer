## Text Summarizer
This microservice uses machine learning to summarize long pieces of text, such as articles, documents, and blog posts. The service could be especially useful for people who need to quickly understand the main points of a large amount of written content.

### Functionality

 - Users input a URL or upload a document, and the service returns a concise summary of the content.
 - The service could include adjustable settings for summary length (e.g., "short", "medium", "long").
 - It could offer summaries in various formats, like bullet points or paragraphs, and perhaps even visualizations like mind maps or infographics.

### Machine Learning Aspect
This service could use a combination of techniques from natural language processing (NLP), such as:

 - Text extraction to pull out the main text from a URL or document.
 - Text segmentation to divide the text into manageable chunks.
 - Named entity recognition to identify important people, places, and things in the text.
 - Keyword extraction to identify the main topics of the text.
 - Extractive or abstractive summarization to create a summary. Extractive summarization involves selecting key sentences from the original text, while abstractive summarization involves generating new sentences that convey the main points.

### Tech Stack
This project will use GoLang, gRPC and AWS.
A Go NLP library like prose or gse could be used for NLP tasks.
